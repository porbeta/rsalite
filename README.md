# RSALite

A lightweight Arduino library to RSA sign and create a JWT token using plain PKCS8 keys (2048 and 4096 bit).

## Description

This library provide a lightweight solution to RSA sign JWT token for secured APIs using OAuth 2.0 JWT authorization.  The current solution only supports plain PKCS8 keys (2048 and 4096 bit), but will be expanded in future iterations

## Example

```
#include <RSALite.h>
```
